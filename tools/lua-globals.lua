-- Accidental-global scanner for the shipped Lua. Run from the repo root:
--
--     lua tools/lua-globals.lua [file ...]
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY luac -p AND THE SMOKE HARNESS BOTH MISS IT.
--
-- In Lua an undefined identifier is not an error. It is a read of a global, which is nil, and it
-- compiles cleanly. So `luac -p` passes, and the smoke harness only notices if a test happens to
-- exercise the exact line -- which it usually does not, because the symptom is a branch that
-- never fires rather than a crash.
--
-- Two real defects in one day, both of this shape:
--
--   * `local Canvas` was declared BELOW Node's methods, so `getmetatable(other) == Canvas` inside
--     Node:swapWith compared against a global -- nil, always false. The guard's diagnostic branch
--     was dead code that read exactly like working code. Shipped, and found by review rather than
--     by any test.
--   * a benchmark renamed `sweeps` to `budget` and left one reference behind. That one DID crash,
--     but only at the end of a run, in game, after a minute of setup.
--
-- The check itself is the compiler's own answer: every global read is a GETTABUP against _ENV in
-- the bytecode, so disassembling and diffing the names against an allowlist finds them exactly,
-- with no parsing of Lua source and no false positives from strings or comments.
