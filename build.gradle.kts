// Make the jar carry its own licence and identity.
//
// MMPL-1.0 is a copyleft licence whose terms have to travel with the binary, and until now the
// jar shipped neither the licence text nor anything identifying itself: the manifest was 25
// bytes, `Manifest-Version: 1.0` and nothing else. That is a publish blocker rather than a
// tidiness issue — a redistributed jar with no licence inside is a jar whose recipient has no
// stated terms.
//
// `metaInf` rather than adding LICENSE.md to src/main/resources: the file belongs at the repo
// root (that is where GitHub and every tool looks for it), and copying it into the source tree
// would create a second copy to drift.
//
// Deliberately `tasks.named<Jar>("jar")`, NOT `withType<Jar>().configureEach`. See the pruning
// block below for why that distinction is load-bearing here: mutating lazily-realized Jar tasks
// broke CI once with a Gradle-internal ConcurrentModificationException. Adding a CopySpec and
// manifest attributes to one named task adds no graph edges, but the narrower form is still the
// right habit in this build.

// Keep build/libs to the CURRENT build's artifacts only.
//
// Jar names embed the git description, so every commit leaves its jars behind and the directory
// accumulates indefinitely — it had reached ~80 files. That is not merely untidy: the version
// comes from a configuration-cached `GitTagVersionSource`, so a build can emit a jar named after
// an OLDER commit than HEAD while the previous newest jar keeps a NEWER-looking name. Picking
// "the latest jar" out of that directory by eye is how a stale jar ends up in a test instance,
// which cost an evening of chasing a callback that was present in the source all along.
//
// Implemented as a doLast on `build` that touches only *.jar, ADDING NO GRAPH EDGES.
//
// The first version registered a Delete task and wired it with
//   tasks.withType<Jar>().configureEach { dependsOn(pruneStaleJars) }
// which passed every local build and broke CI with a Gradle-internal
// ConcurrentModificationException in NodeSets during execution-plan finalization. Adding a
// dependency from configureEach mutates the task graph as Jar tasks are REALIZED, and FPGradle
// realizes several of them lazily, so Gradle ended up modifying a node set it was iterating.
// Local runs missed it because they used --no-daemon with a cold configuration cache; CI reuses
// the configuration and build caches with parallel workers, so tasks realize in a different
// order. Task-graph shape is precisely the thing local builds cannot verify.
//
// Keeping by modification time rather than by version string avoids coupling to how FPGradle
// derives the version -- which is itself configuration-cached and was the reason a build could
// emit a jar named after an older commit than HEAD.

// Regenerate the OCSL golden vectors. Deliberate and manual:

//
// The generator writes the file itself rather than printing for a shell redirect: FPGradle emits
// its "new version available" notice on STDOUT, which -q does not suppress, so redirecting put
// build chatter inside the artifact.
//
// Deliberately NOT wired into `test` or `check`. The file is the frozen expectation a second
// backend is held to, so a build step that refreshed it would mean the suite pinned whatever the
// code last did -- and the first response to a red golden test would be to re-run the build.
