  opengpu -- object wrappers over the OpenGPU component.

  The raw callback surface is 62 functions with several edges that are easy to fall off and
  hard to debug. (62 counts the `opengpu` component only, which is all this library binds to;
  the `opengpu_screen` component adds three more that no program calls directly. The figure
  read 58 until 2026-08-09 — it drifted as setFont, getFontMetrics, setNodeTint and
  swapVisibility landed, none of which thought to update the first sentence of the library.) This library exists to remove exactly those, and each wrapper below earns its
  place against one of them:

    * Failures arrive as `nil, message`, NOT as raised errors, so `pcall` does not catch them
      and an unchecked call fails silently. Everything here raises.
    * `canvasSubmit` takes a packed byte string -- big-endian IEEE-754 doubles and a Java
      modified-UTF-8 string for drawText. No program should hand-roll that.
    * Op ids are wire internals discoverable only through `canvasOps()`. Hardcoding them goes
      silently wrong the first time an op is inserted rather than appended.
    * Node ids are integers that persist INTO THE SAVE. A program that dies holding them
      orphans nodes permanently, so handles here know whether they are still alive.
    * The per-tick submit allowance is back-pressure (`false`), not an error (`nil`). Those two
      returns mean opposite things and want opposite handling.

  Lua 5.2 and 5.3+ are both supported: 5.3 has string.pack, 5.2 has math.frexp, and the double
  packer below picks whichever exists.

  Usage:

    local opengpu = require("opengpu")
    local gpu = opengpu.bind()          -- primary component, nodes cleared

    local c = gpu:canvas(160, 120)      -- offscreen canvas
    c:setColor(200, 40, 40):fillRect(0, 0, 160, 120)
    c:setColor(255, 255, 255):text(8, 8, "hello")
    c:publish()

    local n = gpu:show(c)               -- composite it above the display canvas
    n:moveTo(100, 60)

-- Calling convention

--[[
  Raise on failure.

  The distinction that matters: a callback that FAILED returns exactly `(nil, message)`, while
  one that simply has no return value returns nothing at all. Testing `result == nil` alone
  would turn every `free()` into an error, so the arity is what separates them.

  `false` is never a failure here -- `setResolution` returns it for a no-op and `canvasSubmit`
  for back-pressure, both of which callers are meant to handle rather than crash on.

  Why it exists. A frame too big for one submit is sent as several calls, and the server seals a
  batch on a tick boundary that can fall BETWEEN them. Publish-then-append across that boundary
  means watchers render the first chunk alone: a half-drawn frame. Widening the byte allowance
  made that rare, not impossible, because batch membership is about timing rather than size.

  So do not compose a frame where anyone can see it. Draw into a hidden node over as many calls

  Tint multiplies everything the node draws. Works on ANY node -- sprite or canvas.

  Until 2026-08-09 this refused anything but a sprite, and rightly: the renderer read the tint in
  the sprite path alone, so tinting a canvas converged perfectly on both sides and changed nothing
  on screen, and an invisible no-op is worse than an error. That guard carried an instruction to
  remove it if the renderer ever grew canvas tinting. It has -- the tint is now a per-node
  multiplier applied wherever colour reaches GL -- so the guard is gone.

  What it multiplies, on a canvas: every shape, every glyph, and every texture. The canvas's own
  setColor still cannot modulate a drawTexture (that separation is deliberate and unchanged), but
  the NODE tint applies to the whole node's output, which is what "tint this node" has always
  meant for a sprite.

  Alpha multiplies EVERY PRIMITIVE'S alpha. That is not the same as layer opacity, and the
  difference shows on overlapping content: each primitive blends with what is already beneath it
  inside the same canvas, so a dark bar over a light panel at a=128 lands midway between them
  rather than at half its own value. To dim a composed frame uniformly you still have to redraw
  it; to fade one out, this is the tool.

  TWO EXCEPTIONS, both about alpha:
    * clear() and clearRectangle() HARD-SET their pixels with blending off -- that is what makes
      them a clear rather than a paint, and what lets the canvas compact on them. The tint's RGB
      multiplies them; the tint's ALPHA does not reach them at all. A canvas whose background
      came from clear() keeps that background at full strength however far you fade the rest.
      Use fill() instead if you want the background to fade with everything else.
    * Alpha 0 hides the drawn commands but leaves any cleared region painted, for the same
      reason.

  Send the buffer.

  Back-pressure is retried rather than raised. The per-tick allowance is shared by every

  condition on a busy scene, not a fault. Retrying costs a tick; failing would cost the frame.
]]
--[[
  Send the buffer, splitting it across as many submits as it needs.

  Two failure modes are deliberately handled differently, because they are not alike:

  * OVER THE PER-CALL BYTE CEILING -- not handled, PREVENTED. A frame larger than one submit is
    chunked: the first piece carries `mode`, the rest append. That is safe (commands replay in
    order and append compacts identically) and it is what makes the canvas command cap usable
    at all, since 4096 commands of most ops encode to well over 64 KiB.
  * OVER THE PER-TICK ALLOWANCE -- reported, not retried by default. The allowance is shared by
    every computer on this GPU, so `false` means somebody else got there first.

  Why retry is opt-in rather than automatic: waiting means os.sleep, and os.sleep DISCARDS every
  signal that arrives while it runs. For an interactive program -- anything handling touch, key
  or timer events -- a helpful-looking retry would silently eat the user's input. A program that
  does not care can ask for it with `c:publish{ retry = true }`.

  On a partial failure mid-chunk the buffer is KEPT, not reset, so the caller still holds the
  frame. Note the canvas is then in a torn state: earlier chunks have applied. Re-publishing is
  the recovery, which is why publish() is the safe default for whole frames.

  A group node: a transform parent that draws nothing.

  Children created with `parent = group` inherit its transform, its tint (multiplied into their
  own), its visibility and its z -- so one moveTo, one setTint, one setVisible or one setZ moves,
  fades, hides or re-layers the whole set. A group and its children occupy one contiguous run in
  the scene's z-order; within that run a child's own z orders it against its siblings and against
  the group itself. Groups do NOT nest: a group cannot have a parent, because a parented node may
  not be a parent, so a nested group could never hold anything.

  ONE CAVEAT, and it is the one that will surprise you, because fading a group is most of why you
  would use one: a tint's ALPHA does not reach a canvas region painted by `clear()`. clear() hard-
  sets its pixels with blending off, so the tint's RGB tints them and its alpha does not fade
  them. `group:setTint(255,255,255,0)` makes a child's SHAPES vanish while a cleared background
  stays at full strength. Use fillRect for backgrounds you intend to fade. Same rule as
  Node:setTint, which explains why it cannot be fixed in the renderer.

  Show a canvas as a node. `opts.visible = false` creates it hidden.

  That option exists to close a race in the double-buffer setup this library recommends. Writing

  visible: if a batch seals between them -- which it may, since they are separate direct calls and
  the seal runs on the server thread -- viewers get one frame of an empty back buffer over the
  real one. That is a smaller version of exactly the tear swapWith exists to prevent, in the code
  the documentation tells people to write.

  A hidden node still costs the createCanvasNode call; there is no way to make node creation and
  the hide one delta without a server-side change, so this issues setNodeVisible immediately and
  accepts a one-call window in which nothing has been DRAWN into the canvas yet. An empty canvas
  renders nothing, so the window is invisible in practice -- unlike the version where the canvas
