/**
 * Smooths retained-node transforms across the 20 tps server channel.
 *
 * This is the reason retained nodes exist at all. Node properties land at most once per server
 * tick while the client draws at 60+ fps, so without this a sprite animated from Lua steps
 * visibly — and the only way a program could hide that was to busy-loop without sleeping,
 * burning its whole call budget to raise an update rate it cannot actually raise (the batch
 * seals once per tick regardless). Interpolating here makes 20 Hz updates look like 60 fps
 * motion and costs the program nothing.
 *
 * <h2>Keyframes on the server clock, not a window from arrival</h2>
 * Each node keeps the last two states it was seen in, each stamped with the SERVER TICK that
 * carried it, and rendering samples them at {@link ServerTimeline#renderNanos}. The previous
 * implementation instead lerped over a fixed 50 ms window starting when the batch arrived
 * locally — the naive lerp-from-arrival DESIGN-RENDERER-V2 explicitly warns against. That
 * version is indistinguishable from this one on a LAN and wrong under jitter: a batch 20 ms
 * late compressed a node's motion into 30 ms and the next stretched it, so motion surged and
 * stalled. Replaying against server time means a late batch changes when we learn of a
 * movement, never how fast it appears to happen.
 *
 * CLIENT-ONLY, deliberately. Previous-transform tracking is a presentation concern: putting it
 * on {@link SceneNode} would push it into the shared model, into snapshots via
 * {@code copyStructure()}, and into {@code contentEquals} — where a mirror mid-interpolation
 * would read as diverged from the server.
