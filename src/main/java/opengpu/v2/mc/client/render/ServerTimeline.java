/**
 * The client's smoothed estimate of server time for one scene, and the render clock derived
 * from it.
 *
 * DESIGN-RENDERER-V2 § Animation: "the client keeps a monotonic estimate of server time smoothed
 * from batch arrivals (jitter buffer) and renders the scene at that estimate minus a fixed
 * interpolation delay of 1-2 ticks. Naive lerp-from-arrival stutters under jitter; MC's own
 * entity sync exists for this reason."
 *
 * The first implementation of node interpolation ignored this and lerped over a fixed 50 ms
 * window measured from LOCAL ARRIVAL — precisely the version the design warns against. It looks
 * correct on a LAN, where arrivals are evenly spaced, and degrades exactly where it matters: a
 * batch 20 ms late compresses that node's motion into 30 ms and the next one stretches it, so
 * the sprite surges and stalls. No test can see it, because the defect IS the timing.
 *
 * What this buys, concretely: node motion is replayed against SERVER time, so a late batch
 * changes when we learn about a movement but not how fast it appears to happen.
 *
 * <h2>Why an offset rather than a rate estimate</h2>
 * Server ticks and client nanoseconds both advance at real-time rates, so there is no clock
 * SKEW to estimate — only a fixed unknown offset plus transit jitter. Estimating a rate would
 * fit noise. The offset is smoothed with an EMA and hard-reset when it moves further than any
 * jitter could explain (server restart, a long freeze, a scene epoch change).
 *
 * The offset absorbs one-way transit latency as a constant bias, which is harmless: the render
 * clock is deliberately behind live anyway, and a consistent bias shifts everything equally.
 * What would NOT be harmless is a bias that varies per batch — which is what the arrival-time
 * implementation had.

	 * toward a keyframe we must already HOLD it, so we must render far enough in the past that
	 * the next keyframe has normally arrived. One tick is the theoretical minimum and leaves
	 * nothing for a late batch — the display would stall on the newest keyframe whenever a
	 * batch slipped even slightly. Two ticks tolerates a batch arriving a full tick late.
	 *
	 * The cost is honest and worth stating: node motion appears 100 ms behind the server. For a
	 * program that moves a sprite in response to a click, that is added to the click's own
	 * round trip. Canvas CONTENT is unaffected — it never interpolates and is drawn as soon as
	 * it applies. DESIGN records 1-2 ticks with the exact value to be tuned in Stage B.
