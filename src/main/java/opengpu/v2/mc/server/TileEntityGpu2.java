 *
 * Lifecycle (the GTNH OC pattern): node created in the constructor, joined on the first
 * server tick; scene id = the node address, so the scene is restored (or created) only once
 * the address is known. node.remove() in both invalidate() and onChunkUnload(); deliberate
 * block break additionally destroys the scene (SCENE_GONE + store delete).
 *
 * Thread contract: OC direct callbacks run on machine executor threads; every touch of
 * scene/recording state is synchronized on {@link #sceneLock}. The runtime's per-tick pump
 * and NBT persistence take the same lock on the server thread.

	 * <ul>
	 * <li>{@code PROTOCOL_VERSION} is the WIRE contract between server and client. It bumps on a
	 *     layout change and implies a save migration. A Lua program cannot observe it and cannot
	 *     do anything about it.</li>
	 * <li>the mod version is human-facing and moves on every release, including releases that
	 *     change nothing a program can call.</li>
	 * <li>this is the one a PROGRAM can branch on: "does this build have everything up to N".
	 *     Monotone, never reused, and independent of both of the above.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * 1 = the v2 surface as first shipped. 2 = adds getVersion/getLimits. 3 = adds swapVisibility.
	 * 4 = adds setFont/getFontMetrics and the optional fontId argument to getTextWidth.
	 *
	 * The "SAME change" rule above is not decoration: level 3 was late, because swapVisibility
	 * shipped in the commit after the one that introduced this constant and nobody bumped it. For
	 * that window {@code getVersion().api} reported 2 on builds that HAD swapVisibility and on
	 * builds that did not, which is precisely the distinction the field exists to make — a
	 * feature-detecting program would have concluded the callback was absent and taken the
	 * fallback path forever.
	 *
	 * Level 4 nearly repeated it verbatim: the font callbacks were written, tested and rendered
	 * in-game while this constant still said 3. Note what does NOT catch that — the whole point
	 * of the field is to be readable on a build that lacks the feature, so on the build you are
	 * developing every check passes and every test is green. Only reading this line does.
