	 * a lone 1x1, which is at least a display the player can see and address.

	/**
	 * The origin's render bounds must never cull while any part of the wall is in view.
	 *
	 * Angelica caches and classifies render bounds per TE class and the base implementation
	 * is now the block's collision box, so an unoverridden origin frustum-culls the entire
	 * display the moment its own block leaves view — the wall vanishes while the player is
	 * still looking straight at it. Satellites render nothing, so their bounds do not matter.
	 *
	 * It must be INFINITE, not a wall-sized box, and that is not laziness.
	 * TileEntityRenderBoundsRegistry.classify() sorts a TE class three ways: a box containing
	 * an infinity is INFINITE (never culled); any other box is STATIC, and Angelica then
	 * CACHES it per instance and never recomputes it; only classes named in the
	 * dynamicBoundsTileEntities config get this method called per frame. Our bounds change
	 * whenever a wall is assembled or reshaped, so a finite box is cached while the TE is
	 * still a 1x1 and the display then culls the moment the ORIGIN BLOCK leaves the frustum,
	 * even though the rest of the wall is in plain view — observed in game as the picture
	 * vanishing when the player steps close or looks up. Worse, classify() caches per CLASS
	 * from the first instance it ever sees, so "return the wall box once assembled" cannot
	 * work either.
	 *
	 * A finite box also loses twice, not once: the chunk mesher sorts a TE whose box fits
	 * inside its own 16^3 section into a "culled" list that is walked only through
	 * frustum-VISIBLE sections, so such a screen is section-gated as well as box-tested.
	 * INFINITE puts us in the global list and skips the per-TE test outright.
	 *
	 * Angelica does expose TileEntityRenderBoundsRegistry.registerDynamicClass(String)
	 * publicly, so a soft-dependency call at client init could buy real per-frame culling.
	 * It is deliberately not done: it only pays off if the box here is finite, and then a
	 * registry class that moves — ANGELICA-NOTES warns these churn every release — silently
	 * reinstates this exact bug instead of failing loudly. This TESR early-returns for
	 * satellites and for scenes with no texture, so always dispatching costs a few branches
	 * per screen. Infinite is also Forge's own 1.7.10 default, so vanilla is unaffected.
