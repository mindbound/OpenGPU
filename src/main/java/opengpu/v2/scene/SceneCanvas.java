/**
 * A recorded 2D command list with the decided v2 presentation semantics:
 *
 * - append (autopresent mode): commands accumulate; a command that provably covers the whole
 *   canvas truncates the list (compaction) so long-running accumulate-style programs stay
 *   bounded in practice.
 * - publish (present mode): the given list atomically replaces the visible list.
 *
 * Compaction is deliberately conservative and needs TWO independent conditions. The first is
 * replay-EQUIVALENCE: it fires only when replay-from-scratch of the truncated list is provably
 * identical to replay of the full list:
 * - OP_FILL truncates only if the current color is fully opaque (a translucent fill blends
 *   with prior content) and no transform op has been recorded (transforms recorded earlier
 *   would be lost by truncation, changing later commands' meaning).
 * - OP_CLEAR_RECT (hard set, no blending) truncates regardless of alpha if its rect covers
 *   the full canvas and no transform op has been recorded.
 * The second is ROOM, and equivalence alone is not sufficient: truncation replaces the list with a
 * two- or three-command floor, and the input still to come in the same append lands on top of that
 * floor, so compaction is also declined when the two together would exceed commandCap. See
 * {@link #truncationFits}.
 * After truncation the list becomes [SET_COLOR(current), SET_FONT(current) if non-default,
 * coveringCommand] — the covering command replays with the color it was issued under, and any
 * ambient state that outlives it is re-established for the commands appended afterwards.
 *
 * THE RULE FOR ADDING AMBIENT STATE: any op whose effect persists past the command that
 * follows it must be tracked here and re-emitted by truncateTo. Truncation deletes the command
 * that set it while the renderer starts each replay from defaults, so an untracked one is not
 * just lost — it silently reverts, and only for canvases that happened to compact.
 *
 * Both sides of the wire run this exact logic on the same command stream, so server state
 * and mirrors stay convergent. The command-list cap applies to the visible list; exceeding
 * it throws IllegalStateException (surfaced as a Lua error by the component layer, treated
 * as a resync trigger by mirrors).

	 * Whether the truncated list, PLUS the input still to come, would fit inside

	 *
	 * Compaction REPLACES the list rather than shrinking it, so its output has a floor: two
	 * commands, or three once a font is selected. Nothing bounded that floor against the cap. The
	 * append precheck bounds the INPUT — visible + incoming — and is satisfied before compaction
	 * rewrites anything, so a small-cap canvas could finish an append holding more commands than
	 * its own cap declares.
	 *
	 * {@code remaining} is the half that floor alone does not cover, and it is the half that
	 * reaches ORDINARY caps rather than caps of one or two. Compaction fires in the MIDDLE of an
	 * append, so the input commands behind the covering op are still to be laid on top of the
	 * truncated list. Checking only the floor let a cap-4096 canvas — the default — accept
	 * {@code [FILL, PLOT x4095]}, compact to two on the FILL, and finish holding 4097. The
	 * precheck passed, because it measured the input; the floor check passed, because it measured
	 * the output; nothing measured them together.
	 *
	 * That is not a cosmetic overflow. {@code SnapshotCodec.encode} writes the visible list
	 * without checking the cap, and decode rebuilds the canvas through {@code publish}, which
	 * DOES check — so the scene's own snapshot stops decoding, every client resync fails, and
	 * {@code ScenePersistence.restoreOrFresh} answers the CodecException by deleting the scene
	 * and every texture body it owns.
	 *
	 * Declining to compact is always safe: compaction is a bound on GROWTH, never a correctness
	 * requirement, and the append precheck has already guaranteed the un-compacted list fits.
	 * The decision converges across the wire because it reads only three things: commandCap, which
	 * rides both the snapshot and the persisted record; currentFont, which is tracked identically
	 * on both sides; and {@code remaining}, which is a position within the delta's OWN command list.
	 * Server and mirror both reach this through {@code DeltaApplier} applying the same
	 * {@code Delta.CanvasAppend} ({@code ServerScene.canvasAppend} stages the delta it just
	 * applied), so the list, and every index into it, is identical on both sides.
	 *
	 * The cap-1 case here predates font tracking: [SET_COLOR, FILL] is two commands against a cap
	 * of one. The font re-emission widened the broken set rather than creating it, which is why
	 * this guard covers the shape rather than just the extra command.
