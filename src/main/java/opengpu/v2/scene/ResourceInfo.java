/**
 * One scene resource. Textures carry bytes on the server (persistence + texture-space
 * queries); on a mirror the bytes may be absent until the body transfer completes — that is
 * the designed *pending* state, and referencing nodes render a placeholder until it clears.
 * Canvas resources carry a {@link SceneCanvas} (command-list backed, no bytes by design).
 *
 * <h2>Texture content is MUTABLE (protocol v3)</h2>
 * This is the file where the old clone-once immutability invariant died. {@code writeRegion}
 * mutates texture bytes in place, so a content hash can no longer be the identity: hashing a
 * whole texture per write is O(size) per call, which the streaming workload cannot pay.
 *
 * Identity is instead a monotone {@code version}, and the state is DERIVED from two ints so
 * there is no flag to drift:
 * <pre>
 *   bytes == null                      -> PENDING  (render the placeholder)
 *   bytes != null, version == latest   -> CURRENT  (render the content)
 *   bytes != null, version &lt;  latest   -> STALE    (render last known, refetch scheduled)
 *   version &gt; latestVersion            -> impossible; protocol anomaly -> resync
 * </pre>
 *
 * The hash survives only where it is already free: {@code knownHash} is computed once per
 * body serve and once per version for persistence, and travels as a verifiable cache hint
 * ({@code knownHash} is the content of version {@code knownHashVersion}, not necessarily of
 * the current one). It is never recomputed on a write.
