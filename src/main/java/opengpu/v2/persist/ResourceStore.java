 * Minecraft layer decides the root location (a directory under the world save); tests use
 * a temp directory.
 *
 * Contract (the four SaveHandler lifecycle gaps from the design review, closed by design):
 * writes may be asynchronous, but {@link #load} MUST observe any in-flight write for the
 * same key (wait on the pending future); {@link #delete}/{@link #deleteScene} remove bodies
 * on resource free / scene destruction (bodies must never leak — they are large);
 * {@link #flush} joins all pending writes (call on world unload / server stop so shutdown
 * never truncates a body); a load that returns null or fails validation is the caller's
 * degraded-path trigger, never an exception.

	 * body blobs carry no scene-incarnation marker ({@code frameBody} writes magic, format,
	 * version, hash, length, payload — nothing identifying), and {@code ScenePersistence.restore}
	 * accepts a framed body on a LENGTH match alone. So a body left in place at id 2 attaches
	 * silently to whatever the next incarnation happens to create at id 2 with the same
	 * dimensions — no warning, no degraded flag, the player's new texture holding the old one's
	 * pixels. That is a misread, which this codebase ranks as worse than deletion.

	 *         nothing to archive.
