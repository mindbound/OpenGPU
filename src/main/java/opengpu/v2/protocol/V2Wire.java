	 * Bumped 4 -> 5 on 2026-08-11 for transform parenting: SceneNode gained `parent`, which
	 * widened both the NodeCreate delta and the persisted node record. This is the FIRST bump
	 * that moved the persisted record rather than the op table, and it is the one the extension

	 * is therefore readable, not byte-identical: see SnapshotCodec's version gate and the
	 * justification attached to its entry in LAYOUT_COMPATIBLE_PERSISTED_VERSIONS. The op table
	 * did NOT change in this bump, which is the other half of the question that policy makes
	 * every bump answer.
	 *
	 * THE BUMP AND THE OP TABLE MUST MOVE TOGETHER, and that is the only thing protecting

	 * unknown ops outright, so a client of the wrong vintage discards the whole batch before
	 * it can misread anything — which is why the renderer can assert that unknown ops cannot
	 * arrive. Add an op without bumping this and that guarantee inverts: two builds share a
	 * version number, disagree about the op table, and an old client decodes the new op's
	 * argument as some other op's payload. See ProtocolVersionTest.

	 * Bumped 8 -> 9 on 2026-08-22 for ANIM-13(b): the heartbeat carries the server tick.
	 *
	 * THE CHEAPEST SHAPE A BUMP CAN HAVE, and worth naming as the counter-example to 5 and 8
	 * above. It touches neither the op table nor any PERSISTED record: the heartbeat is a
	 * transient message that no save ever contains. So v8 joins
	 * LAYOUT_COMPATIBLE_PERSISTED_VERSIONS unchanged — its layout IS v9's layout — and this bump
	 * differs from 7 -> 8, which moved the node record.
	 *
	 * IT STILL OWED A GOLDEN FIXTURE, and the first draft of this comment claimed it did not.
	 * The scoping reasoned that an unchanged layout has nothing to pin; the migration guardian
	 * refused the bump and was right. What a v8 fixture proves is not that the layout survived
	 * -- it did not move -- but that the v9 READER still ACCEPTS an 8, which is the entire risk
	 * of a bump like this one: forget to whitelist the outgoing version and every existing world
	 * answers by losing its scenes on first chunk load. See
	 * PersistedVersionMigrationTest.aV8StructureStillDecodesAfterTheHeartbeatGainedATick.
	 *
	 * Why it was spent at all: an animator scene is network-silent by design, and until now the
	 * only message such a scene received carried seq alone. ServerTimeline is fed only from an
	 * applied batch, so a silent scene's clock estimate froze at its last batch and free-ran on
	 * wall time; when a batch finally arrived past the 500 ms re-base threshold the timeline
	 * snapped and `time` stepped BACKWARD, which for a pure function of time means every
	 * animator on that scene pops with nothing to interpolate. One long on a message already
	 * being sent removes the free-run outright.

	 * Deltas per batch.
	 *
	 * LOWERED 1&lt;&lt;16 -&gt; 1&lt;&lt;15 on 2026-08-09, because the claim directly above was false in the
	 * BYTE dimension. The count cap and the payload caps were each enforced, but nothing bounded
	 * their product against the decoder's ceiling: 65536 deltas x 81 B (a full-mask NodeProps,
	 * the widest delta a server can produce) is 5.3 MB, and with the write and submit
	 * per-batch allowances on top the worst case reached 5.6 MB against a
	 * BatchCodec.MAX_INFLATED_BYTES of 4 MiB. The server would have produced a batch that EVERY
	 * client refuses whole — a silent desync, not a crash, and invisible to convergence
	 * checking because no mirror ever applies it.
	 *
	 * NOT fixed by adding a byte check at seal, because ServerScene.sealBatch ALREADY has a
	 * seal-time check on this cap and it throws. A second one on a byte predicate would only
	 * reach the same throw by a different route; by seal the batch is assembled and the tick is
	 * spent, so the choices are crash the pump or send something known to be undecodable.
	 *
	 * What lowering the cap actually buys is the removal of a failure MODE. Sizing the two caps
	 * against each other leaves the loud failure (the existing IllegalStateException) as the only
	 * one, and deletes the silent one, where a batch ships and every mirror refuses it.
	 *
	 * The cost is a band that changes behaviour. Above 47,331 deltas a batch was undecodable, so
	 * (47331, 65536] silently desynced and is now caught; but (32768, 47331] previously WORKED
	 * and now throws. That band is unreachable in practice: MAX_NODES is 4096 and a node
	 * contributes at most a couple of deltas per tick, putting a pathological full-scene rewrite
	 * near 8192 — a 4x margin — against 143 B/tick and a 24,662 B largest batch in the heaviest
	 * bench2 run. BatchSizeBoundTest pins BOTH sides, so neither raising this into the
	 * undecodable range nor lowering it into the reachable one passes silently.
	 *
	 * Those two bounds leave the window [32768, 47331], and 1&lt;&lt;15 is the only power of two in
	 * it — 1&lt;&lt;14 puts the pump's throw back in reach, 1&lt;&lt;16 is where this started. The value
