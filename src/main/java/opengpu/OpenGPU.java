	/**
	 * Abandon the deleted legacy block/item ids rather than letting FML treat them as damage.
	 *
	 * This is the single method that decides whether an existing world still loads after the
	 * cut-over, and none of its failure modes are caught by javac, by the test suite (all of
	 * which is v2-only) or by CI. The fields it used to remap onto are plain {@code Block} /
	 * {@code Item} in this class, so deleting their registrations leaves them silently null and
	 * still compiling — {@code light} and {@code advancedlight} are already in exactly that
	 * state today.
	 *
	 * <h2>Why the names are abandoned and not remapped</h2>
	 * OpenGPU is a separate mod, not an updated OCLights2, so it makes no promise to carry old
	 * worlds. More sharply: remapping these onto {@code gpu_v2}/{@code screen_v2} would be
	 * actively destructive. {@code GameData.processIdRematches} requires the re-registered id to
	 * equal the old one, and in any world that already knows {@code gpu_v2} it cannot, so the
	 * load aborts with "the world state is utterly corrupted". That trap passes on a test world
	 * predating gpu_v2 and fails on every current one.
	 *
	 * <h2>Why the domain list is wider than it looks</h2>
	 * These ids live under THREE domains: "OpenGPU:" for any world saved by a current jar, plus
	 * the pre-rename "OCLights3:" and "OCLights2:". The version of this method before the
	 * cut-over handled only the latter two and {@code continue}d on everything else — which
	 * would have left every current world's own ids unhandled. Note also that FML writes the
	 * whole registry snapshot into level.dat, so a world carries these ids whether or not a
	 * block was ever placed.
	 *
	 * Unhandled is not a warning: singleplayer prompts and force-backs-up the world, a
	 * dedicated server BLOCKS on a console query, and a client joining a server is refused the
	 * handshake outright with no prompt at all.
	 *
	 * {@code ignore()} rather than {@code warn()}: both load, but warn() makes FML log its
	 * "may cause world breakage" banner on every subsequent load, forever, for a condition that
	 * is permanent and intended. Matched by name rather than by domain so that a genuinely
	 * missing {@code gpu_v2} still surfaces loudly instead of being swallowed.
