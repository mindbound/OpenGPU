/**
 * That font-loading trouble is REPORTED, and that a healthy load stays quiet.
 *
 * Both halves matter and this project has been bitten by having only one. A diagnostic nobody
 * emits is the defect being fixed here — {@code loadResource} returned null for both "absent" and
 * "unreadable" while {@code parse}'s javadoc promised a wrong cell height would be "loud, and
 * obvious in a log". A diagnostic that fires on healthy input is worse, because it trains
 * everyone to ignore the channel.
 *
 * Needs no Minecraft: {@link FontDiagnostics} exists precisely so the font package can report
 * without reaching for the mod's logger, which was a static assigned in preInit and would have
 * thrown NullPointerException from inside the degraded path meant to keep things running.
